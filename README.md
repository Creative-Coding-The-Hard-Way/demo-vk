# Demo-VK

Every time I experiment with Vulkan, I end up writing the same handful of
utilities and starting points. This repo is a collection of some of the most
common.

## External Dependencies

- [Latest Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)

- `slangc`: The [shader-slang](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang) compiler
  is expected to be on the system PATH. The compiler binary is available as part
  of the Vulkan SDK.
